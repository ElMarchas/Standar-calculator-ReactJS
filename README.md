# Standar Calculator
This is a simple calculator developed in JavaScript using ReactJs to test the ReactJs hooks between components.

The calculator must work same that the Microsoft Standar Calculator, which the style was taken from.

A thing to have in mind, i used the eval function from JavaScript to resolve the ecuaciones, eval is not recommended but is easy to implement, take care of that if you need, you can call a function instead.
